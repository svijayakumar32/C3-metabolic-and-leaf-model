The gpmain files contain scripts which run an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the distribution of proteins in the e-Photosynthesis model using CM_Drive (carbon metabolism). 
Each script is suffixed by the crop name (potato) and the Ci at which optimization was run (129,140,160,180,200,220,240,260,280,300,320,340,360,380,400,420).
